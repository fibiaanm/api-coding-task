# API Backend Coding Task

This is the technical test project for API oriented backends.

## About

- The API is built using DDD (Domain Driven Design) and Hexagonal Architecture.
- The API uses the Slim Framework as the HTTP layer.
- The Requests have a validation layer using the `Respect\Validation` library.
- The Responses are normalized using a Response builder class and with model transformers.
- The API uses native sql queries to interact with the database.
- The API uses JWT for authentication.
- The API has a middleware to validate the JWT token.
- The API has a helper function to simplify the access to the current user.
- The API has a middleware to validate authorization.
- The API has redis as a cache system.
- The API has documentation using OpenAPI.
- The API has tests using PHPUnit.
- The database had a migration to create the tables and seed to populate the tables.
- There are some configurations on the database to grant correct character encoding.
- The repository has hooks before commit to run the tests.
- The repository has a GitHub Action to run the tests and code quality validation on every push.

## Build

```bash
make build
```

- This command executes the Docker image building process and performs the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) dependencies installation.
- This command will also create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file.

## Run

```bash
make run
```
- This command starts the Docker containers and the PHP built-in development server.
- The API will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
- The database will be available at `localhost:3306`.
- The database credentials are on the `.env` file.
- There is a Redis container available at `localhost:6379`.

## Stop

```bash
make stop
```

## Documentation

The API documentation is available at [http://localhost:8080/api/documentation](http://localhost:8080/api/documentation).

## Tests

```bash
make test
```

- This command executes the PHPUnit tests.
- This command will execute the Integration tests.
- The tests are located in the `tests` directory.

## Cach√©

- The API uses Redis as a cache system.
- The cache is enabled by default.
- The cache TTL is set to 60 seconds.
- All the services to list and get detail use the cache.

Type `make help` for more tasks present in `Makefile`.

## Functional requirements

**Implement a CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) API.**

The following add-ons will be positively evaluated:

- [x] Authentication
- [x] Authorization
- [x] Cache
- [x] Documentation

---

A light infrastructure is provided with a populated MySQL database with example data and a web server using PHP built-in development server.

## Non functional requirements

- The presence of unit, integration and acceptance tests will positively appreciated.
- Use whatever you want to achieve this: MVC, hexagonal arquitecture, DDD, etc.
- A deep knowledge about SOLID, YAGNI or KISS would be positively evaluated.
- DevOps knowledge (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.) would be appreciated too.
- It's important to find a balance between code quality and deadline; releasing a non functional application in time or a perfect application out of time may be negatively evaluated.
- Good and well-documented commits will be appreciated.
- Efficient and smart use of third party libraries will be positively appreciated.

Beyond the requirements of this test we want to see what you can do, feel free to show us your real potential and, the
most important part, have fun!
